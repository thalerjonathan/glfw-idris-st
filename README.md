# glfw-idris-st
A new library providing glfw bindings for idris.
In contrast to the already existing glfw-idris https://github.com/eckart/glfw-idris library,
which is using Algebraic Effects, this one is using the ST approach as introduced in the
ST tutorial http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/st/index.html and Edwin Bradys paper
